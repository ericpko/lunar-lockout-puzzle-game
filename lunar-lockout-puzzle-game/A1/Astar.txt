Suppose you want to use A* and you have a heuristic that may overestimate or
underestimate cost to the goal by as much as 20%. Can you do anything to
guarantee the algorithm will find the optimal solution (if one exists)?

1) If a heuristic overestimates the cost to the goal, then it is not admissable.
If a heuristic is not admissable, sometimes it overestimates the cost to reach
a goal, and might choose a path with a higher cost than the optimal path.

Therefore, if a heuristic sometimes overestimate and sometimes underestimates,
then whenever it overestimates, it has a chance of missing an optimal solution
because it thinks the goal requires more moves than is actually necessary. To
guarantee the algorithm will find the optimal solution, you could always
multiply the heuristic function by (1 / 5) to reduce the amount that the
heuristic overestimates.


(True or False) Assume you you are playing Lunar Lockout on a board that has
three xanadus. The sum of the Manhattan distances between each xanadu and the
exit is an admissible heuristic for this problem, should you use A-star to
solve it.

2) True in this specific case. Since we can assume that the Manhattan distance
is an admissable heuristic in this case, then using A* will lead to an optimal
solution.
